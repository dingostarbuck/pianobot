# pianobot
a bot that clicks on a certain part of the screen to play the piano (holy fuck read the readme)


FIRST THINGS FIRST HOLY SHIT

you MUST run this program in at least python 3.7, I've only tested 3.7 so I know it works there, it will straight up not work in the latest version (3.9)

why? Because god hates us.

But in actuality it appears to be a bug within python 3.9 perhaps, that seems to be the general consensus.

code taken from Kian Brose video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAIUA-Oc1Y&t=0s
(as you can see the version he is using is indeed 3.7, so if you want this program to work you will have to download 3.7 version of python.

I used PyCharm so I simply downloaded 3.7 and then created a new python file within PyCharm using 3.7 as the interpreter.

I only upload this to github as a record so that whomever is attempting to learn this program has a firm answer as to how to fix this particular problem.

Because as it turns out constantly having the answer "lmao just use a venv" is incredibly frustrating.
